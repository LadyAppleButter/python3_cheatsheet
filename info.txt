[2021 Feb 28 Sun 10:05pm] To keep my website skills fresh and to keep up with the lingo of python, this basic website is created. For know, I following the Codecademy cheatsheets and adding examples where fit. In the future, information from LinkedIn and other sources will be added. Currently, I sure how far I want to take this. Right now, I am copying the format from the first cheatsheet I did with HTML and CSS. Although I have started a repository for this project thru git; I am going to (attempted) to write all updates and changes here, so if this is dropped for some time and I come back to it, I know what work was and was not done.

	"Added the basic webpage structure to hello_world.html; including a title and a h1 heading."
