[2021 Feb 28 Sun 10:05pm] To keep my website skills fresh and to keep up with the lingo of python, this basic website is created. For know, I following the Codecademy cheatsheets and adding examples where fit. In the future, information from LinkedIn and other sources will be added. Currently, I sure how far I want to take this. Right now, I am copying the format from the first cheatsheet I did with HTML and CSS. Although I have started a repository for this project thru git; I am going to (attempted) to write all updates and changes here, so if this is dropped for some time and I come back to it, I know what work was and was not done.
	
	[10:21pm] 	"Added two files: index.html and style.css. Dont not know why I did not initially include a css file. As for the index.html; the idea is to create a homepage that connects all the lessons together." 	
	"Added the basic webpage structure to hello_world.html; including a title and a h1 heading." 


[2021 March 3 Wed 11:24pm] Updated the hello_world webpage. Created the table; added the table heading, constricted the basic bones of the table. Entered the names each row. Completed the 'Comments' section. Added classes to each section. 


[2021 March 4 Thur 4:57pm] Added content for theses sections: Arithmetic Operators, Plus-Equal Operators, and Variables. Added  classes for all name, description and example headings. Added a key for the short handed class names. 

[2021 March 8 Mon 8:30pm] Finished adding content to the webpage: Modulo, Intergers, Float Point, SyntaxError, NameError, ZeroDivision Error, Print Function, Strings, String Contenation sections have been completed filled. Moved Variables to the top, place Strings and String Contenation together, place all errors sections together, place Intergers and Float Point together. 

Next time, start formating. Position the heading and text to make more appealing, change the font face, change size and add a background color.
